# Compose Van gogh
An Android project built with Jetpack Compose to demonstrate canvas API usage(Bezier curves, drawArcs, clipPath,...).
Jetpack compose is reactive way of developing UI's and more easy to develop a full fledge application or prototype something. 
I was following the updates to Compose UI from some time and this time decided to do something with the Canvas. I can say I was never this much close to the Native Canvas Api's of the Android which i feel today after doing some experiments with it. I feel happy what i have achieved till now with it and excited to show you all.
