# Compose Van gogh
Jetpack compose is reactive way of developing UI's and more easy to develop a full fledge application or prototype something. 
I was following the updates to Compose UI from some time and this time decided to do something with the Canvas. I can say I was never this much close to the Native Canvas Api's of the Android which i feel today after doing some experiments with it. I feel happy what i have achieved till now with it and excited to show you all.
